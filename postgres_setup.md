# Setup Postgres

Here's the [postgres docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/), which can be useful for setting stuff up.

## Install Postgres

1. Install brew cask if you haven't already.

    * Install brew. Instructions [here](http://brew.sh/)
    * Install brew cask with: `brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask`
    
    If you already have them, update: `brew update && brew upgrade brew-cask`

1. Install your Postgres database. The easiest way to to install the pre-build application (with an adorable icon) using the following command:

     ```
     brew cask install postgres
     ```

    If you don't have homebrew, go [here](http://brew.sh/).

2. After the installation is complete, use Spotlight to search for `postgres` and open the Application. It will ask you if you want to move it to the Applications folder, say "Move it"


## Setting up psql on a Mac

1. Open spotlight (click on magnifying class in upper right) and type in "Postgres" to open the postgres server. Click "Yes" to move to Applications folder. You should now have an elephant symbol in the top bar.

2. Go to the home directory by running `cd` in the terminal

3. Open terminal configurations:

      `open ~/.bash_profile`

3. Insert the following line at the end of the file and save the file.

      ```export PATH=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin:$PATH``` 

4. Open a new terminal and run `psql`  

## Install psycopg2

1. Install with pip: `pip install psycopg2`

2. You might get this error message when you try to import the module: `Library not loaded: libssl.1.0.0.dylib`

      Here’s a [stack overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27264574/import-psycopg2-library-not-loaded-libssl-1-0-0-dylib) with the solution. Basically psycopg2 is looking for a module that's in a different space on your computer and you need to setup a symbolic link (shortcut) to the module. Use these commands (replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual username).

      ```
      sudo ln -s /Users/YOURUSERNAME/anaconda/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib
      sudo ln -s /Users/YOURUSERNAME/anaconda/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib
      ```
